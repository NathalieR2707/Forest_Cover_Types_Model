# Forest_Cover_Types_Model
Multi Class Classification Model - Supervised Learning

Multi Class Classification Model on predicting the forest cover types of the Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado. 
EDA, Feature Engineering and experimentation with Logistic Classifier, KNN Classifiers, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Bossing.

Future work on this project:
- Hyperparameter tuning and XG boost
- Smote Technique to address imbalanced data set
